Apartmentâ€™s plinth area in thousands. 
Here is the Apartment complex with 3 blocks, 
each block containing 3 floors and each floor is having 3 flats.
Maintenance amount of flat 2 in floor 1 in block 2 is 14K
Operations Manager of the Apartment complex need to 
submit monthly report quiting how much money is generated 
from Maintenance charges for each block and for overall Apartment complex.

All three apartments put together, gives the figure how much 
this gated comminity is genetaing money out of Maintenance amount.
