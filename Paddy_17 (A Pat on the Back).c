Mrs. Nitya Kulkarni is a faculty teaching C Programming Language. She is tracking the
international rank of every student as given in the competitive coding platforms weekly. In order to
encourage studentsâ€™ participation, she displays details like Name, Section, CGPA, and
international rank of the student who gets rank less than 2000 in common website.
Assist Nitya Kulkarni in performing this commendable task.

Algorithm
---------
1.Construct a structure based on the given data.
2.Take the input on how many students you are taking data.
3.Store the data of each student in an array of the above declared datatype by using for loop.
4.Check the cgpa of each student by using if loop, if the cgpa is less than 2000 print the data of the corresponding student.
